# CRUD operations for DROAME


### *Description*
* this is an application made with nodeJs and MongoDb to perform the CRUD operations for different user's data. This is made only for the operator and hence no login authentication is there. It is only for the organisation to maintain records of the customer booking.


#### Before Using Install Important Library 

`Install the Public Dependencies`

`Install the Server Dependencies`

`In the Server Directory there's a .env file. Change the value of mongodb inside the file. Set the value as your mongodb connection url. I have used my database and set it to public, so the project will run directly also`

`Now start the server by yarn start/npm start`

`Now start the react by yarn start/npm start`

`And the  application would be running successfully by now.`
